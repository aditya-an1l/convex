# ‚úÖ Commit Message Guidelines

Writing clear and consistent commit messages makes collaboration easier, improves code review, and enhances project maintainability. Here‚Äôs how to write effective commit messages.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è General Guidelines

* **Use imperative mood** in the summary
  *Example: "Add feature" (‚úîÔ∏è) instead of "Added feature" (‚úñÔ∏è)*

* **Start with a short summary** (max 50 characters if possible).
  This summary should clearly state **what** the change does.

* **Add an optional body** to explain the **why**, **how**, or **impact** of the change.
  Keep lines within 72 characters.

* **Group commits by intent** using standard commit types (see below).

## üß† Why This Matters

* Makes the commit history easy to read
* Helps reviewers understand your changes quickly
* Enables better release notes and changelogs
